# odin-recipes

The main goal of this project is to use very fundamentals of HTML to create
a simple recipie website. For this project only HTML will be used. 

From the project , I familarized myself with common html tags. But the most important gain for me personally was getting used to using git to keep track of my changes and whole process.
